Scaffolding industry has no scaffold weight calculator that is online. The first Project I built to assist with this was writtel in PHP entirely.

Further to this, I then built one with C# which still functions. However learning JavaScript this could be an exciting project since everyone has access to the internet and the screen would have less clutter with JS as you can make elements disappear.
